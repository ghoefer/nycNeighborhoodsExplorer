# NYC Neighborhood Explorer

This project allows users to explore directions from several neighborhoods in NYC at once. It was created as part of a course assignment at the Rhode Island School of Design (RISD).

## Description

For this project, I used the Google Maps dataset in a new way. Google Maps is great for figuring out how to get from your work to home (Point A->Point B), but when moving to a new city, you might want to explore many different potential homes (Point A -> Point B, C, or D), which Google Maps doesn’t currently support. In New York some neighborhoods are further away in physical distance, but might have a shorter commute because they have direct transit. Many moving into the city aren’t familiar with the transportation system yet, so they need a way to explore each neighborhood without typing it in manually every time.

This project allows users to explore the commute from anywhere to multiple neighborhoods at the same time and sorts the commutes by shortest time. Users can also filter the neighborhoods down by price.
